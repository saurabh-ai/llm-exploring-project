# Learning Notes: Data Processing with Streams

## Overview
This project demonstrates comprehensive usage of Java 8+ Streams API, lambda expressions, functional programming concepts, and custom collector implementations.

## Key Learning Achievements

### 1. Java Streams API Mastery
- **Stream Creation**: Multiple ways to create streams (from collections, arrays, generators)
- **Intermediate Operations**: filter, map, flatMap, distinct, sorted, peek, limit, skip
- **Terminal Operations**: collect, reduce, forEach, findFirst, anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Understanding that streams don't execute until a terminal operation is called
- **Stream Reuse**: Streams are single-use and cannot be reused

### 2. Lambda Expressions and Method References
- **Lambda Syntax**: `(param) -> expression` and `(param) -> { statements; }`
- **Method References**: `ClassName::methodName`, `object::methodName`, `ClassName::new`
- **Functional Interfaces**: Predicate<T>, Function<T,R>, Consumer<T>, Supplier<T>
- **Custom Functional Interfaces**: Creating domain-specific functional interfaces

### 3. Advanced Collectors
- **Built-in Collectors**: toList, toSet, toMap, groupingBy, partitioningBy, counting, averagingDouble
- **Custom Collector Implementation**: Using `Collector.of()` to create specialized collectors
- **Collector Composition**: Combining multiple collectors for complex aggregations
- **Parallel Collector Safety**: Understanding thread-safety requirements in parallel streams

### 4. Functional Programming Concepts
- **Immutability**: Using records for immutable data models
- **Pure Functions**: Functions without side effects
- **Function Composition**: Combining simple functions to create complex behaviors
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take or return other functions

### 5. Parallel Stream Processing
- **When to Use**: CPU-intensive operations on large datasets
- **Thread Safety**: Ensuring thread-safe operations and collectors
- **Performance Considerations**: Understanding when parallel streams help vs hurt
- **ForkJoinPool**: How parallel streams utilize the common pool

## Code Examples and Patterns

### Stream Pipeline Pattern
```java
result = collection.stream()
    .filter(predicate)          // Intermediate operation
    .map(transformation)        // Intermediate operation
    .sorted(comparator)         // Intermediate operation
    .collect(collector);        // Terminal operation
```

### Custom Collector Implementation
```java
public static <T> Collector<T, ?, Statistics> toStatistics(ToDoubleFunction<T> mapper) {
    return Collector.of(
        Statistics::new,                    // Supplier (create accumulator)
        (stats, item) -> stats.accept(mapper.applyAsDouble(item)), // Accumulator
        Statistics::combine,                // Combiner (for parallel processing)
        Function.identity()                 // Finisher
    );
}
```

### Functional Composition
```java
Predicate<Person> isHighEarner = person -> person.salary() > 100_000;
Predicate<Person> isExperienced = person -> person.yearsOfExperience() >= 5;
Predicate<Person> qualifiedCandidate = isHighEarner.and(isExperienced);
```

### Complex Grouping Operations
```java
Map<String, Map<String, Long>> departmentDemographics = people.stream()
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
        Person::department,
        Collectors.groupingBy(
            this::getAgeGroup,
            Collectors.counting()
        )
    ));
```

## Performance Insights

### Parallel vs Sequential
- **Sequential**: Better for small datasets, I/O operations, or stateful operations
- **Parallel**: Better for CPU-intensive operations on large datasets (typically >10,000 elements)

### Stream Operation Optimization
- **Early Filtering**: Apply filters early in the pipeline to reduce data volume
- **Limit Operations**: Use limit() to avoid processing unnecessary elements
- **Primitive Streams**: Use IntStream, LongStream, DoubleStream for numeric operations

### Memory Efficiency
- **Streaming Processing**: Avoid collecting to intermediate collections
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Operations only execute when needed
- **Stateless Operations**: Prefer stateless operations for better performance

## Design Patterns Applied

### Builder Pattern
Used in configuration classes and search criteria builders for flexible object construction.

### Strategy Pattern
Custom collectors represent different strategies for data aggregation.

### Template Method Pattern
Stream processing follows a template: create stream → intermediate operations → terminal operation.

### Functional Composition Pattern
Combining predicates, functions, and other functional interfaces.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Stream Operations
- Test individual stream operations in isolation
- Use small, controlled datasets for predictable results
- Verify both happy path and edge cases (empty streams, null values)

### Custom Collector Testing
- Test accumulator function behavior
- Test combiner function for parallel processing
- Test finisher function output formatting

### Integration Testing
- Test complete stream pipelines end-to-end
- Verify performance with larger datasets
- Test parallel vs sequential behavior

## Best Practices Learned

### Stream Usage
1. **Keep it Simple**: Don't over-complicate stream chains
2. **Prefer Method References**: Use method references when possible for readability
3. **Avoid Side Effects**: Keep operations pure and avoid modifying external state
4. **Use Appropriate Collections**: Choose the right collector for your use case

### Performance
1. **Profile Before Optimizing**: Don't assume parallel is always better
2. **Consider Data Size**: Parallel streams shine with larger datasets
3. **Minimize Boxing**: Use primitive streams when working with numbers
4. **Reuse Predicates**: Define predicates once and reuse them

### Code Organization
1. **Separate Concerns**: Keep data models, processors, and collectors separate
2. **Use Records**: For immutable data transfer objects
3. **Document Complexity**: Add comments for complex stream operations
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Especially custom collectors and parallel operations

## Advanced Concepts Demonstrated
