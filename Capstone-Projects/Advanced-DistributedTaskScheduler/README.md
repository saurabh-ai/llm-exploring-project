# Distributed Task Scheduler System

A comprehensive distributed task scheduler system demonstrating advanced Java concepts including microservices architecture, job queuing, monitoring dashboard, and fault tolerance. This capstone project consolidates all Phase 3 learning objectives: Design Patterns, JDBC Database Integration, and Spring Framework.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This system implements a microservices architecture with the following components:

### Core Services
- **Eureka Server** (Port 8761): Service Registry and Discovery Server
- **Config Service** (Port 8888): Centralized configuration management
- **User Service** (Port 8081): User authentication, JWT tokens, role-based access control
- **Scheduler Service** (Port 8082): Core scheduling engine with job management using Quartz
- **Executor Service** (Port 8083): Distributed task execution workers with load balancing
- **Notification Service** (Port 8084): Multi-channel notification delivery (Email, SMS, Push)
- **Monitoring Service** (Port 8085): Real-time dashboard and metrics collection
- **API Gateway** (Port 8080): Single entry point with routing and circuit breaker patterns

### Technology Stack

## üìä Features Demonstration

### 1. Job Management
```bash
# Create a new job
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Daily Report Job",
    "description": "Generate daily reports",
    "priority": "HIGH",
    "cronExpression": "0 0 9 * * ?",
    "jobClass": "com.example.ReportJob",
    "maxRetries": 3
  }'

# Schedule the job
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs/{job-id}/schedule

# Get all jobs
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs
```

### 2. Job Execution Types
The executor service supports multiple job types:
- `com.example.EmailJob`: Email sending simulation (2s execution)
- `com.example.ReportJob`: Report generation simulation (5s execution)  
- `com.example.DataImportJob`: Data import simulation (10s execution)
- Default jobs: Generic task simulation (3s execution)

### 3. Monitoring Dashboard
Visit http://localhost:8083/dashboard to see:
- Real-time job statistics
- System health monitoring
- Recent job executions
- Job status distribution

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all unit tests
mvn test

# Run tests for specific service
cd scheduler-service && mvn test
```
